Function Notes

I want to search for a selection element based on a dropdown menu.
if (selection="chicken", 
  loop through the calendar array
  highlight all choices in yellow
  give option to select all checkbox
    selects all
    grays out selected to indicate a choice made
  else
    select manually)

I want to select based on a favorited item.
if (selection="class="fav" contains="chicken nuggets",
  loop through the calendar array
  if selection is one of two choices
    gray out days selected to indicate a choice made
  else if neither choice is selected
    leave white background)

I want to add an image for each item listed in text.
if (itemSelectionText="chicken nuggets")
{
image src = "chickenNuggets"
}
